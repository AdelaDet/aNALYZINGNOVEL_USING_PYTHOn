# Code Map

Code Map aggregates user submitted online resources and groups them into sequential learning paths which are managed using the Neo4j graph database. Graph databases excel at managing highly connected data and complex queries.

As learning paths are completed, resources are reviewed and rated which allows Code Map to recommend higher quality learning material based on user ratings and connections.
